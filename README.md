# Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview

Stock price prediction involves forecasting the future prices of stocks listed on stock exchanges. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the stock prices based on historical data. Accurate stock price predictions can help traders make informed decisions, potentially leading to higher returns on investments.

## Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Gather historical stock price data, including open, high, low, close prices, and trading volumes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for training machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features that can help improve the predictive performance of the models.
- **Modeling**: Implement various machine learning models to predict future stock prices.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics to ensure their effectiveness.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the results to provide insights into the model predictions.

## Data Collection

The historical stock price data can be collected from various financial APIs such as:

- [Yahoo Finance API](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
- [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/)
- [Keggle](https://keggle.come/)

The data typically includes the following fields:

- `Date`: The date of the trading day.
- `Open`: The opening price of the stock.
- `High`: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.
- `Low`: The lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
- `Close`: The closing price of the stock.
- `Volume`: The number of shares traded.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
2. **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale the features to ensure that they contribute equally to the model.
3. **Time Series Considerations**: Create lagged features or rolling statistics to capture temporal dependencies.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing data to improve model performance. Examples include:

- **Moving Averages**: Calculate moving averages (e.g., 7-day, 30-day) to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
- **Volatility Measures**: Compute historical volatility to capture market uncertainty.
- **Technical Indicators**: Include technical indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), etc.

## Modeling

Several machine learning algorithms can be employed for stock price prediction, including but not limited to:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple regression model to predict future prices.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that can capture complex relationships in the data.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series prediction.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting framework that often yields high performance.
